Description

The Random Pac_Man Simulation is a fun and interactive web application that demonstrates basic physics with moving and bouncing objects on the screen. This project primarily uses HTML and JavaScript to create and animate Pac-Man-like balls that bounce off the edges of the browser window.

How to run the code:

Step1:Save the HTML file with .html extension.

Step2:Add pac man: When you click the "Add" button, a new ball is created with random initial positions and added to the screen.

step3:Move the PacMan: Once the "Move" button is clicked, the balls start moving based on their velocities and reverse direction upon hitting the boundaries of the window.



Future Improvement
  Implement a simple slider to let users adjust the speed of the PacMans. Add buttons to pause the movement of pacMan and reset the simulation for a fresh start.
